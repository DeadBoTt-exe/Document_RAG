\## Service Responsibility

The billing-service is responsible for invoice generation, tax calculation, discounts, and final invoice persistence.



\## Invoice Creation

Invoices are created when an order reaches the COMPLETED state. Each invoice contains:

Discounts are applied before tax calculation. Supported discount types:

\- Flat discounts

\- Percentage discounts
